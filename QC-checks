table of function and descriptions of checks in VME database

Check | Details | type of error
---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
Deep-sea sponge aggregations | VME\_HabitatType like 'DS’ = TaxonLatinName not like 'Acanella arbuscula' | Warning 
Cold-water coral reef | VME\_HabitatType like 'CC' = TaxonLatinName not like 'Acanthogorgia' | Warning 
Cold-water coral reef | VME\_HabitatType like 'CC' = TaxonLatinName not like 'Alcyonacea' | Warning 
Cold-water coral reef | VME\_HabitatType like 'CC' = TaxonLatinName not like 'Alcyoniina' | Warning 
Cold-water coral reef | VME\_HabitatType like 'CC' = TaxonLatinName not like 'Geodia ' | Error 
Cold-water coral reef | VME\_HabitatType like 'CC' = VME\_HabitatSubtype not in ('HB%’, ‘SB%’, ‘VA’, ‘VI’) | Error 
Coral Gardens | VME\_HabitatType like 'CG' = VME\_HabitatSubtype not in ('LMR’, ‘SVR’, ‘VA’, ‘VI’) | Error 
Mud & sand emergent fauna | VME\_HabitatType like ('BP', 'SCA', 'TAA', 'XA') = VME\_HabitatSubtype not in ('HB%', 'SB%', 'LMR', 'SVR', 'VA', 'VI') | Error 
Sea-pen fields | VME\_HabitatType like ‘SP’ = VME\_HabitatSubtype not in ('HB%', 'SB%', 'LMR', 'SVR', 'VA', 'VI') | Error 
Hydrothermal vents/fields | VME\_HabitatType like ‘HTF’ = VME\_HabitatSubtype not in ('HB%', 'SB%' 'LMR', 'SVR') | Error 
Gorgonian | If TaxonLatinName is 'Acanthogorgia' and VME\_Indicator is not null, the VME\_Indicator should be 'GG'? | Error 
Soft Coral | If TaxonLatinName is ' Alcyoniina' and VME\_Indicator is not null, the VME\_Indicator should be 'SC'? | Error 
Soft Coral | If TaxonLatinName is ' Alcyonacea' and VME\_Indicator is not null, the VME\_Indicator should be 'SC'? | hello
The reported depth (DepthUpper, DepthLower, DepthShoot, DepthHaul) is shallower than 190 m?	A check as to whether this record would be classed as coming from shallow water.  Generally, shallow water records would not be included within the VME Database without strong justification.	Warning
CruiseID check	A check to see whether the CruiseID already exists within the database. If it does, this could signify a resubmission of data.	Warning
Start date cannot be after end date of cruise/survey	This check ensures that the start date of the cruise/survey does not occur after the end date.	Critical Error
ObservationDate check	The ObservationDate must occur between the StartDate and EndDate of the cruise/survey.	Critical Error
VME_Habitat_Type is not valid for trawl data	This checks that VME_Habitat_Type records have not been associated with trawl DataCollectionMethod types.  Trawls can only be associated with VME_Indicator records	Critical Error
Sample position (StartLatitude/Longitude, MiddleLatitude/Longitude, EndLatitude/Longitude) is on land	A check as to whether either the start, middle or end position of a sample is on land, with land being classed as ‘shallower than’ the ‘0 m’ isobath from the Gebco global bathmetry dataset.	Critical Error
Invalid species name or AphiaID 	Species names and/or AphiaID are checked against the current WoRMS  database for errors.	Critical Error
GeometryType check	If the GeometryType is classified as ‘Line’, then StartLatitude/Longitude and EndLatitude/Longitude  should not be blank	Critical Error
VMEKey check	VMEKey cannot be blank if VME_Habitat_Type  is populated	Critical Error
VME_Indicator check	When the VME_Indicator field is populated, either the GeneralTaxonDescriptor and/or the TaxonLatinName or AphiaID should be populated	Critical Error
Mixing of VME data submission types	VME Indicator cannot be populated when VME_Habitat_Type is populated (and vice versa)	Critical Error
MiddleLatitude 	The MiddleLatitude should be between StartLatitude and EndLatitude, although note that some ROV transects may twist and turn, meaning that this rule will not be true.	Warning
MiddleLongitude 	The MiddleLongitude should be between StartLongitude and EndLongitude, although note that some ROV transects may twist and turn, meaning that this rule will not be true.	Warning
All Mandatory fields	A general check that all mandatory fields are populated	Critical Error
Check of DataCollectionMethod with GeometryType 	For ‘SITC’, ‘SIROV’ and other towed camera systems, an expectation that the GeometryType would be ‘Line’, with a different start and end lat/long	Warning
Cross check of record depth with GEBCO	Extract depth (start/end) from record and compare with GEBCO dataset (would need a predefined depth tolerance – for example 10% difference). Flag (and state apparent difference) if large difference between GEBCO depth and record depth 	Warning
Incorrect spatial position information	Check that the location of the record does not fall outside the study area – for example should be within the NEAFC, NAFO or EU member states waters	Warning
